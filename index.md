Hi! I am an ecosystem ecologist currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the USDA-ARS in Fort Collins, Colorado (see [here](https://github.com/cu-esiil-edu/shortcourse-01-get-started-oliviahaj/blob/main/Get_Started_with_Open_Reproducible_Science_files/Get_Started_with_Open_Reproducible_Science_57_1.png) for temperature trends in Fort Collins). Prior to this position, I received my PhD from Colorado State University in 2023; my dissertation research focused on understanding ecosystem responses to shifts in the seasonal timing of water availability. I continue to be interested in understanding how climate change is affecting ecosystem structure and function - particularly extreme weather events.
