# Olivia Hajek
I am an ecosystem ecologist currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the USDA-ARS in Fort Collins, Colorado. Prior to this position, I received my PhD from Colorado State University in 2023; my dissertation research focused on understanding ecosystem responses to shifts in the seasonal timing of water availability. I continue to be interested in understanding how climate change is affecting ecosystem structure and function - particularly extreme weather events.
